# fashion-MNIST

This project uses Zalando MNIST database to train a neural network to classify images of clothing. The challenge was given during our bootcamp course at EPICODE Global. 

The project consists of 4 files: data handler, model, training, and a Streamlit application. 

Technologies used in the project:

- Python
- PyTorch

How to run the project:
1. Use the data handler to download the dataset;
2. Use the train file to train the model and save;
3. Run the Streamlit application to see it in action on your browser.

During the project, we have learnt how to create a good neural network for image classification and train it properly with high accuracy. 

The model can classify between images of different types of clothing.
