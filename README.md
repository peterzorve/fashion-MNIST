# fashion-MNIST

This project uses Zalando MNIST database to train a neural network to classify images of clothing. The challenge was given during our bootcamp course at EPICODE Global. 

The project consists of 5 files: data handler, model, prediction, helper functions, and a Streamlit application. 

The prediction file takes the trained model from model.py file and used it on the test set and real world images from the local directory. 

Technologies used in the project:

- Python
- PyTorch
- Streamlit
- Torchvision

How to run the project:
1. Use the data handler to download the dataset;
2. Use the prediction file to train the model and save;
3. Run the Streamlit application to see it in action on your browser.

During the project, we have learnt how to create a good neural network for image classification and train it properly with high accuracy. 

The model can classify between images of different types of clothing.
